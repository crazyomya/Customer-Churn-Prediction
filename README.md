# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn, which is crucial for retaining customers and ensuring business sustainability. By developing a machine learning model, we aim to identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing us to take proactive actions to retain them.

## Contents

- **Data**: The dataset used for this project is stored in `data/customer_churn_dataset.csv`. This dataset contains historical customer information, including features like 'Age,' 'Gender,' 'Location,' 'Subscription_Length_Months,' 'Monthly_Bill,' 'Total_Usage_GB,' and the target variable 'Churn' (indicating whether a customer churned or not).

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks (`customer_churn_prediction.ipynb`) containing the code and analysis for the project.

- **Models**: Trained machine learning models are saved in the `models` directory for later use or deployment.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed to run the project:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- keras
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn keras matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the Jupyter notebook `customer_churn_prediction.ipynb` to execute the code and perform customer churn prediction.

4. Optionally, you can deploy the trained models for real-time predictions in a production environment.

## Conclusion

This project serves as an exploration of customer churn prediction using machine learning techniques. While the provided code and analysis offer valuable insights, further customization and optimization may be required based on your specific dataset and business context.
