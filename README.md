# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn, which is crucial for retaining customers and ensuring business sustainability. By developing a machine learning model, we aim to identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing us to take proactive actions to retain them.

Contents
Data: The dataset used for this project is stored in data/customer_churn_dataset.csv. This dataset contains historical customer information, including features like 'Age,' 'Gender,' 'Location,' 'Subscription_Length_Months,' 'Monthly_Bill,' 'Total_Usage_GB,' and the target variable 'Churn' (indicating whether a customer churned or not).

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks (customer_churn_prediction.ipynb) containing the code and analysis for the project.

Models: Trained machine learning models are saved in the models directory for later use or deployment.

Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed to run the project:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
keras
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn keras matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory.

Run the Jupyter notebook customer_churn_prediction.ipynb to execute the code and perform customer churn prediction.

Optionally, you can deploy the trained models for real-time predictions in a production environment.

Conclusion
This project serves as an exploration of customer churn prediction using machine learning techniques. While the provided code and analysis offer valuable insights, further customization and optimization may be required based on your specific dataset and business context.
